# Ghost helper

Your one stop shop for early game item management.

Have you ever wondered;

-   Do I already have enough items in my mall to build this blueprint?
-   Do I have enough raw material in my inventory to craft the required items?
-   Which part of this blueprint still has ghosts?
-   Where are all the items required for these ghosts?
-   Where are all the remaining ghosts?
    Well look no further! Ghost helper is here to resque you.

With ghost helper you can:

-   See how many ghosts of a certain item are built in the game
-   See how many items of said ghosts are already available in any inventory
-   Quickly craft the required number of items for said ghosts

# Features

Ghost helper gives a three level visual indication regarding the ghosts you want to build:

-   Green: All items are available to build all the ghosts of this type
-   Orange: Not all items are available, but the player has enough raw material to hand craft the required items
-   Red: Insufficient items and/or insufficient raw material to craft the required number of items

Ghost helper provides quick access for hand crafting, provided the player has enough raw material for said item:

-   Craft one item
-   Craft five items
-   Craft all required items

Ghost helper makes the crafting buttons available only for the required number of ghosts, so you don't overproduce a certain item which leads to a shortage of another item. Especially in the early stage of the game when resources are still critical you want to grow your factory as fast as possible with the least amount of items required.
